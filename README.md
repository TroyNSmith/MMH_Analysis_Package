# MMH_Analysis_Package

## Getting Started with Pixi
This project uses Pixi for environment and dependency management. Pixi is a fast, reproducible tool similar to conda, but with better performance and built-in support for scripting and multi-platform environments.

### 1. Install Pixi
Run the following in your terminal:
```curl -sSf https://prefix.dev/install.sh | bash```

Then restart your terminal (or follow the post-install instructions to update your `PATH`).

Verify installation:
```pixi --version```

### 2. Clone This Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/TroyNSmith/MMH_Analysis_Package.git
cd MMH_Analysis_Package
```

To do:

1. Change tick number sizes
2. Re-run susceptibility & ISFs
3. Implement changes to non-Gaussian
4. Add a correlation function for radial bins

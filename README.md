# MMH Analysis Package
A package of Python scripts intended to analyze simulations generated by the MMH research group.

## Getting Started
This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for environment and dependency management. Pixi is a fast, reproducible tool similar to conda, but with better performance, built-in support for scripting and multi-platform environments, and full compatibility with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools are installed:
#### Git
| Platform | Install Command or Link                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Run through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) & follow Linux |
| MacOS    | Pre-installed or run `brew install git` (with Homebrew) |
| Linux    | Run `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu)              |

Verify installation:
```
git --version
```

#### Pixi
| Platform | Install Command or Link                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Run through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) & follow Linux |
| Linux    | Run `curl -sSf https://prefix.dev/install.sh \| sh`           |

Verify installation:
```
pixi --version
```

Then restart your terminal (or follow the post-install instructions to update your `PATH`).

### 2. Clone This Repository
Follow the steps below to generate an SSH key and get access to this GitHub repository using SSH.
#### I. Generate an SSH Key (If You Don't Already Have One)
Open a terminal and run:
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Press **Enter** to accept the default file location
- Create a passphrase if you'd like, or press **Enter** to skip

#### II. Add Your SSH Key to GitHub
&#9312; Copy your public SSH key to your clipboard:
```diff
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
- Select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
- displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
```
&#9313; In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile picture, then click &#9881; **Settings**.

&#9314; In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  &#128273; **SSH and GPG keys**.

&#9315; Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**.

&#9316; In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using this for a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal Laptop".

&#9317; Select the type of key, either authentication or signing. For more information about commit signing, see [About commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

&#9318; In the "Key" field, paste your public key.

&#9319; Click **Add SSH key**.

&#9320; If prompted, confirm access to your account on GitHub.

For more information on SSH keys, visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

#### Clone the Git
Inside of your terminal, navigate to (or create a) directory for the package to be hosted locally:
##### &#9398; Navigate to a Directory
```
cd /path/to/your/directory
```

##### &#9399; Create a Directory
```
cd /path/to/a/directory
mkdir Example
cd Example
```

Within the selected directory, clone the git:
```
git clone git@github.com:TroyNSmith/MMH_Analysis_Package.git
cd MMH_Analysis_Package
```

### 3. Set Up the Environment
Inside the project folder, **activate** the environment:
```
pixi shell
```
All dependencies and tools will be available automatically in this shell.

### 4. Open in VS Code
From the terminal:
```
code .
```

In VS Code:
- Install the **Python** extension.
  *optional*
- Use `ctrl+\` to open the terminal and run `pixi shell`.
- Set the Python interpreter: `Ctrl+Shift+P` &#8594; `Python: Select Interpreter` &#8594; `Pixi env`.

### 5. Pull and Push Changes
[Git pulling](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull) allows a user to sync their local branch with a source branch, providing the most recent version to the local machine. Alternatively, a user can provide updates to the source branch from their local branch by [Git pushing](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push). These features are intended to streamline collaboration and version control, ensuring that all contributors are working with the most up-to-date codebase while avoiding the need for manual file transfers. In practice, this means changes can be shared, reviewed, and deployed more efficiently&#8212;all from the command line.

#### Pull:
```
git pull origin main
```

#### Commit and Push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your message."
git push origin main
```

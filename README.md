# MMH Analysis Package
A package of Python scripts intended to analyze simulations generated by the MMH research group.

## Pixi
This package uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for environment and dependency management. Pixi is a fast, reproducible tool similar to conda, but is shipped with a software package and is fully compatible with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

| Platform | Install Command or Link                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Run through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) & follow Linux |
| Linux    | Run `curl -sSf https://prefix.dev/install.sh \| sh`           |

Verify installation:
```
pixi --version
```

Then restart your terminal (or follow the post-install instructions to update your `PATH`).

Inside the project folder, **activate** the environment:
```
pixi shell
```
All dependencies and tools will be available automatically in this shell.

*If you would rather use conda, necessary packages are listed under **dependencies** in `pixi.toml` and can be manually installed.*

*Note: A custom version of mdevaluate is hosted as a local module within this package.*

## How to use
A variety of python and bash scripts are contained in `src/`.

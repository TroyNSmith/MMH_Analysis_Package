# MMH Analysis Package
A package of Python scripts intended to analyze simulations generated by the MMH research group.

Note that new functionalities are being implemented to provide resources for students to learn MD analysis in Python and facilitate easier access to the workings of employed codes, however **original functionalities** should still work as intended. Newer scripts stored under `src` are currently in development.

In the **future**, this package will include JuPyter notebooks to facilitate user interaction with Python scripts as well as ported code from `mdevaluate` due to its limited documentation and steep learning curve.

## Getting Started with Pixi
This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for environment and dependency management. Pixi is a fast, reproducible tool similar to conda, but with better performance, built-in support for scripting and multi-platform environments, and full compatibility with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools are installed:
#### Git
| Platform | Install Command or Link                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Run through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) & follow Linux |
| MacOS    | Pre-installed or run `brew install git` (with Homebrew) |
| Linux    | Run `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu)              |

Verify installation:
```
git --version
```

#### Pixi
| Platform | Install Command or Link                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | Run through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) & follow Linux |
| Linux    | Run `curl -sSf https://prefix.dev/install.sh`           |

Verify installation:
```
pixi --version
```

Then restart your terminal (or follow the post-install instructions to update your `PATH`).

### 2. Clone This Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/TroyNSmith/MMH_Analysis_Package.git
cd MMH_Analysis_Package
```

### 3. Set Up the Environment (Optional)
Inside the project folder, **activate** the environment:
```
pixi shell
```
All dependencies and tools will be available automatically in this shell.

### 4. Run Jupyter Notebook for Interactive Docs (Optional)
Once inside the Pixi environment, run:
```
jupyter lab
```

### 5. Open in VS Code
From the terminal:
```
code .
```

In VS Code:
- Install the **Python** extension.
- Use `ctrl+\` to open the terminal and run `pixi shell`.
- Set the Python interpreter: `Ctrl+Shift+P` &#8594; `Python: Select Interpreter` &#8594; `Pixi env`.

### 6. Pull and Push Changes
[Git pulling](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull) allows a user to sync their local branch with a source branch, providing the most recent version to the local machine. Alternatively, a user can provide updates to the source branch from their local branch by [Git pushing](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push). These features are intended to streamline collaboration and version control, ensuring that all contributors are working with the most up-to-date codebase while avoiding the need for manual file transfers. In practice, this means changes can be shared, reviewed, and deployed more efficiently&#8212;all from the command line.

#### Pull:
```
git pull origin main
```

#### Commit and Push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your message."
git push origin main
```
